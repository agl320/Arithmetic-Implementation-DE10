# DE-10 Standard Calculator

Small VHDL project that allows numerical operations between two 5 bit numbers, with the ability for 2 bit floating point (fractional form) precision (truncated to 1 digit in result due to the limits of hex displays on the board).

Features:
- Forward and previous state traversal
- Selective load for values and operations
- Error catching
